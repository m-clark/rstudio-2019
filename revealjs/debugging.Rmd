## What is Debugging?


<span class="emph">Debugging</span> is merely finding and fixing problematic code.

  - Code will always have bugs

Debugging is an essential part of creating functions.

## A note about functions

If you are doing anything more than twice, write a function!

- It's more generalizable
- It's more reproducible
- It's more efficient

Debugging can allow one to spot issues

RStudio can even help you get started transforming existing code to a function

- Ctrl+Alt+X/Cmnd+Opt+X on highlighted code


## Debugging in RStudio

There are numerous facilities within R to help you debug your code.

- Break Points

- <span class="func">browser</span>

- <span class="func">debug</span>

- <span class="func">debugonce</span>

- <span class="func">traceback</span>


RStudio makes the process pretty easy.


## Debug Mode Commands


There are commands that allow you to work through debugging:

- Next (n)/Return: runs the next line

- Step into (s): if the next line is a new function, it enters into the function

  - Careful with this one; you can get pretty far into other functions

- Finish (f): finishes the function

- Continue `(c)`: stops debugging and runs the function

- Stop (Q): stops debugging and does not run the function


## Debug Mode Commands

Each of these also has a button in the debugging menu

## Profiling

Code <span class="emph">profiling</span> allows one to see what parts of the code take most of the processing time and resources (memory)

Like debugging, there have always been tools in base R for this, but RStudio makes it easy to profile any code.

Furthermore, it doesn't have to be an explicit function.

## Profiling

## Debugging and profiling

Debugging and profiling are important parts of advanced programming.

One should desire to make code as general and reproducible as possible.

- Regardless of expertise!

RStudio makes the process more interactive and flexible.
