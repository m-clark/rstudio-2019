## Overview

RStudio can integrate <span class="emph">version control</span> into your project

  - Subversion
  - Git
  - Both are free and open (we'll focus on Git)


## Wait, Wait! What Is Version Control?

At its most basic, it is just a way to manage changes

  - Documents, code, etc.

Especially useful when collaborating

- Track who is making changes and what they are changing
- Revert changes back to an earlier version
- Merging multiple copies of a document into one
- Branched development

Git works on a distributed model

  - Users create their own local repositories

Tools that use Git to share code on the web

  - Bitbucket
  - GitLab
  - GitHub

Public vs. private repositories


## GitHub

GitHub provides hosting services for Git repositories

And is also a social network for software developers...

... or just people who do fun things with code!

Stay ahead of the game by following R developers!

## Process (Briefly)

  - Commit changes made (including file creation)
  - Push up to repository
  - Pull from repository changes others have made


## GUI vs. the Shell

RStudio makes it easy to commit, push, pull, revert, etc.

If you need other things, you can access the Git shell directly

## Version Control

RStudio can integrate version control into your projects

You have nothing to lose by keeping track of changes to files

This is *especially* useful when collaborating
